					<h3>About Leann</h3>
					<p>Leann Nguyen was born on June 13, 2001. She has one older brother and is the owner of three dogs. She and her family get along very
						closely. Leann does not have many close friends, but she keeps those few she does have very dear in her heart. Leann likes to eat the Buldak Carbonara Noodles and Tofu and Kimchi dumplings we make together. She will also eat anything spicy (but not too spicy).<br><br>
						
						The food she likes to eat the least have a lot of meat; she is more of a vegetarian. Her family often says that she is on a poor manâ€™s diet. On the topic of food, Leann has the ability to cook delicious meals, however she never has time to do so.<br><br>
						
						Her role models are Tifa Lockhart from FFVII and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coser.karina/" target="_blank">Karina Coser</a>. She admires their strong, independent personalities and their beautiful figures and faces. Her all-time fictional crush is Sephiroth from FFVII because of his overwhelming strength, daunting figure, handsome and beautiful facial features, and his luscious silver locks.</p>
